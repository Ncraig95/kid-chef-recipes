  "steps": [
    "Gather all the ingredients and wash your hands.",
    "Pour the warm water into the mixer bowl. Sprinkle in the sugar and yeast. Give it a quick stir and let it sit for 5 minutes until it looks foamy.",
    "Add the flour and salt to the bowl. Attach the dough hook.",
    "Turn the mixer on low. Drizzle in the olive oil. Let the mixer knead until the dough pulls away from the bowl and looks smooth (about 3\u20134 minutes).",
    "Lightly flour the counter. Take the dough out and knead it with your hands for 1\u20132 minutes to make it extra smooth.",
    "Rub a little oil inside a clean bowl. Put the dough in, turn it once so it\u2019s lightly coated, and cover with a towel. Let it rise in a warm spot for about 1 hour, or until it doubles in size.",
    "Punch the dough down to let the air out. Split it in half (this makes two 12\u2011inch pizzas) or keep it whole for a thick crust.",
    "Shape, top, and bake your pizza at 475\u202f\u00b0F (245\u202f\u00b0C) for 12\u201315 minutes until golden."
